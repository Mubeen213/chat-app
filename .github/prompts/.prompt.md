## 🧭 OVERALL OBJECTIVE

**Build a smart AI flight concierge that allows corporate travelers to search, compare, and optionally book flights using natural language.**

---

## 🎯 KEY GOALS FOR THE HACKATHON DEMO

- Accept **natural language queries** like:  
  > "I need a flight to Delhi next Monday, morning. Prefer Vistara. Budget ₹10,000."

- Extract structured intent:  
  → origin, destination, date, time preference, airline preference, budget

- Fetch matching flights from your **company's internal API** (or mock).

- Present **top flight options** with explanations/comparisons.

- Optionally ask if the user wants to book, and proceed with a booking flow.

- Some other prompts could be, what flight is best to pick up?
- Can you comapare and provide a cheaper flight for delhi next Monday.

## 🔁 FLOW DIAGRAM

```text
User → Chat UI → MCP Server
                 └─► Parse intent (LLM):
                       from, to, date, time, airlines, budget
                   └─► Query Flight API (mock or real)
                   └─► Summarize Results (LLM)
                   └─► Return answer to chat UI
                   └─►Booking Intent Flow
```

## 💡 CORE CAPABILITIES TO SHOWCASE

1. **Natural Language to Structured Query** (via LLM)
2. **Flight Search Based on User Intent**
3. **LLM Response Formatting** for easy-to-read options
4. (Optional) **Follow-up Conversations** like:
   - “Any cheaper options?”
   - “What’s the shortest flight?”
   - “Can you book the 8 AM one?”


- We need to build the Model context protocol server that will be invoked by
 using tools function calling provided by LLMs.
